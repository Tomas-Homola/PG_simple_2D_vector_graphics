# App for simple 2D vector graphics

Final project from Computer Graphics classes. All algorithms were implemented from scratch using C++, such as line rasterization (DDA, Bresenham's algorithm), polygon color fill (scan-line algorithm), drawing of Bezier curves, geometric transformations (move, scale, rotate selected object), ability to send selected object up or back. Export current canvas and then import it back to continue working with it.
